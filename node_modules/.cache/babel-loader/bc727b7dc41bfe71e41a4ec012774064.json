In the spring of 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Ever since I was a child I've had a passion to to experiment and teach myself new things. Recently I have been teaching myself how to write cheats for some online videogames using C#. I like to dabble in just about everything not just technology. I play a little guitar and a little piano, occasionally I make EDM tracks with FL Studio. I'm an amateur acrylic painter. I play about 15 games of chess a day, and I like writing reviews for places on Google. Check out some of my projects below.
